# FL-Player

A minimal mobile media player built for personal use.

The goal: handle multiple media files as a playlist. For example, drop TV show episodes on the phone, open the app, select them, and watch in sequence.

I know exists other apps that do this, but I wanted a simple solution with my own code.

## Features

- Playlist screen
- "+" button to add media
- Tap an item to start playback
- Playback on a separate screen
- Basic state handling (e.g., playback continues after orientation change)

## Tech Stack

Built with Android Native using Jetpack Compose.  
Most code can be adapted to web, desktop, or iOS via Compose Multiplatform.

## Future

Possible expansions:
- Store media in a database for persistence and metadata
- Support external servers, file indexing, downloads, or streaming ultra basic streaming of online resources
